      A beautiful home in the suburbs? A countryside cottage? For myself, it's a
      simple log cabin in the forest; somewhere beside a river, surrounded by
      conifers, and far from the nearest civilization. Can you smell the fresh
      air?</span

    Hi! My name is Lovepreet Kaur. From a very young age I've been pretty much
    obsessed with computers. How do they work? What else can they do? Questions
    like these drove me down a never-ending path of self-discovery which has led
    to countless awards, certificates, and an insurmountable level of experience
    working with a large range of technologies spanning from embedded IoT
    firmware to distributed cloud infrastructure.
  </p>
  <p class="font-normal text-neutral-500 text-xl mt-4">
    I graduated from the University of Guru Nanak Dev in 2015 with my Bachelor's
    in Computer Science the top 8% of my class. I did work as a software Tester
    in WINFOTECH and AICHUNKS company. I love what I do, and I am constantly
    expanding my skills. When I get the chance, I love to visit the pacific
    northwest and spend my days in the mountains and my evenings in a kayak on
    the lake.

    This website is a showcase of my hard work and determination that has gotten
    me to where I am today. Take a look around and feel free to shoot me a
    message. Thanks for stopping by!
